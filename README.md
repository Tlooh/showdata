# Showdata - A multiple visualization tool for dataÔºÅ
---
Inspired by the [showdata](https://github.com/silverbulletmdc/showdata), we can visualize and compare large the data in webserver. But it is not always statisfy the requirement. 

# Examples

## 1. `imgae` files grid

I set two ways to grab the image files by setting the option `only_imgs`.

+ `only_imgs = True`: It will grab all the image files in the folder.

+ `only_imgs = False`: It will list the `subdirs` under the folder, and then compare the image files in the subdirs.
